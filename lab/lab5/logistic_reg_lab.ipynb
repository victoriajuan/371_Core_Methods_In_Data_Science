    "In logistic regression, the outcome (dependent variable) has only a limited number of possible values. So, it is used when the dependent variable is categorical in nature. With the dependent variable categorical, we know this regression will be classifying data into seperate groups. We'll look at iris data on the different species of flowers. Our task is to predict the species based on the flower data. The data contains sepal and petal information. Based on the sepal and petal sizes, we'll classify the flower species using logistic regression and regularization. The dataset includes leaf data for three species of iris: setosa, virginica, and versicolor"
